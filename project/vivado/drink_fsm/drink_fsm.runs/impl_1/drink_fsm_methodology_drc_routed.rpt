2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell charge_val_reg[2]_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) charge_val_reg[1]/CLR, charge_val_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell next_state_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) next_state_reg[0]/CLR, next_state_reg[1]/CLR, next_state_reg[2]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch charge_val_reg[0]/L7 (in charge_val_reg[0] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin charge_val_reg[0]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch charge_val_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin charge_val_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch charge_val_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin charge_val_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch next_state_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin next_state_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
